## 👁 What Is Albion ESP?

**ESP (Extra Sensory Perception)** is a visual overlay that shows **live enemy positions, resource nodes, loot, and mob info** through obstacles. It’s a core part of most cheat tools, giving you total map awareness without needing to scout or guess.

Think of it as **X-ray vision** for Albion’s full-loot world. 🔥
